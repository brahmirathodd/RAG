# Adaptive RAG and NLU-Driven Query execution for Personalized Insurance Recommendation using LangGraph

Welcome to the Adaptive RAG and NLU-Driven Query Execution for Personalized Insurance Recommendations project! This repository showcases the development of an interactive AI-driven system to provide personalized insurance policy suggestions, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like LangGraph, NLU (Natural Language Understanding), and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

## üöÄ Project Overview

This solution integrates various AI components to offer a seamless, personalized, and interactive experience for insurance policy recommendations:

- NLU-Driven SQL Query Execution: Processes user inputs to recommend insurance policies based on user profiles and data.
- Adaptive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Provides context-aware and accurate responses to policy-related inquiries, thanks to self-reflection mechanisms.
- REPLPython Agent: Executes Python code on the fly to ensure accurate calculations based on the formula generated by the LLM (Large Language Model).
- Tavily AI Web Search: Augments the chatbot‚Äôs knowledge by handling general insurance-related questions beyond the stored dataset.


## üí° Key Features
- Personalized Policy Recommendations: Insurance policies tailored to user profiles based on SQL queries.
- Dynamic Response Generation: Adaptive RAG ensures that answers to user queries are both contextually appropriate and factually accurate.
- Python Code Execution: Executes real-time Python code for precise insurance calculations.
- Web Search Integration: Handles external queries using Tavily AI to provide broad coverage on insurance topics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- LangGraph: Framework for building multi-agent systems and dialogue-based applications.
- Python: Core language for execution, including dynamic Python code generation.
- NLU: Natural Language Understanding for processing user inputs.
- RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context-aware responses.
- Tavily AI: AI-powered web search engine for answering broad insurance queries.

This diagram explains how each component works together to deliver personalized recommendations and intelligent responses.

üîç How It Works

- User Profile Input: The system takes inputs from the user to create or access their insurance profile.
- Policy Recommendation: Using NLU-driven SQL execution, policies are suggested based on the user‚Äôs profile.
- Adaptive RAG: Queries related to policy details are answered with context-aware responses using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation mechanism.
- Python Execution: LLM-generated formulas are executed via the REPLPython agent to ensure accurate calculations.
- Web Search: Tavily AI is invoked for answering general insurance-related questions beyond the system‚Äôs stored knowledge.
